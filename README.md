# Metacoda Identity Sync Utilities (idsync-utils)

This repository contains extra samples and SAS macros that can be used with the
[Metacoda® Identity Sync Plug-in](https://www.metacoda.com/en/products/security-plug-ins/identity-sync/).
Metacoda customers and partners, and potentially other SAS customers, may find these utilities
useful when setting up an identity synchronisation process between a [SAS®](http://www.sas.com/)
Metadata Server and an external identity provider, such as Microsoft Active Directory.
